There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of newer Angular and [MSAL.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js)
 
Check it out: [active-directory-b2c-javascript-angular-spa](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-angular-spa)
 
If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-angular-spa/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
